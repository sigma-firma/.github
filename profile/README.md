## DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, & CONTINUOUS DELIVERY & INTEGRATION
The first stage of our development cycle consists of analyzing a 
project's scope to design a linear workflow around it, aiming for 
completion within the client's time-frame and budget. Complex tooling 
often requires a myriad of finely-tuned and optimized services working in 
unison. **sigma ⚡︎ firma** designs, creates, deploys, and maintains these 
services, and helps teams do the same. Our product delivery process 
implements a continuous integration and deployment pipeline, automating 
and streamlining builds, tests, security audits, version control, backups, 
staging, deployments, and other workflow mechanisms, using state-of-the-art
cloud-based solutions, microservices, and unique, custom tooling, to quickly 
and reliably deliver fully functional products to end-users.

##  DATA REFINEMENT

Data refinement is the analysis and transformation of data into useful 
information. Our company can help your company build tools for 
data mining and analysis, capable of exposing valuable insights and extracting 
hidden statistics, revealing long-term and achievable avenues of revenue,
